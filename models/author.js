/*
.virtual('url'): This creates a virtual property named url on the author schema. Virtual properties are not persisted in the database, 
 but are computed on-the-fly when needed.


Regular functions have their own this context, whereas arrow functions do not. In this context, this refers to the instance of the author document.


The template literal (${this._id}) is used to dynamically insert the author's _id into the string.






The schema defines an author as having String SchemaTypes for the first and family names (required, with a maximum of 100 characters),
and Date fields for the dates of birth and death.


We've also declared a virtual for the AuthorSchema named "url" that returns the absolute URL required to get a particular instance of the model
 â€” we'll use the property in our templates whenever we need to get a link to a particular author.
